      <p>Hello! My name is Chris. I was born in Seattle and currently work remotely from my hometown in northern Idaho. I work for a marketing agency based in downtown Seattle and our focus is on marketing project management, content management and web development. About five years ago I finished up my MBA from DePaul University in Chicago, but once I found web development decided that I&rsquo;d rather go a more technical route than spend my days sitting in meetings.</p>

      <p>In my first few weeks at Epicodus I’ve had the chance to create a few different projects. Below I’ve highlighted my favorites. I’ve also included links to their GitHub repos as well as a bit of context for each. Please check them out if you’d like.</p>

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
