      <p>Hello! My name is Chris. I was born in Seattle and currently work remotely from my hometown in northern Idaho. I work for a marketing agency based in downtown Seattle and our focus is on marketing project management, content management and web development. About five years ago I finished up my MBA from DePaul University in Chicago, but once I found web development decided that I&rsquo;d rather go a more technical route than spend my days sitting in meetings.</p>

      <p>In my first few weeks at Epicodus I’ve had the chance to create a few different projects. Below I’ve highlighted my favorites. I’ve also included links to their GitHub repos as well as a bit of context for each. Please check them out if you’d like.</p>

      <p>I started out my job history working in restaurants – primarily to pay for video games and later housing and school. After under grad I worked on the manufacturing floor of an engineering company near my hometown. I worked there for a year before heading to Chicago for grad school. During my MBA program I focused on sports management and marketing, with dreams of working for a Chicago sports team (<em>like every other mid-20s guy in town</em>). I quickly realized that industry wasn&rsquo;t for me and got a job with Bank of America working in their ultra-high-net-worth marketing division. Unfortunately, financial services wasn’t the industry for me either, which led me to my current position in Seattle. My marketing agency gives me the opportunity to do project management and web development work while trying to grow my skills as a developer. I look forward to continuing that journey here at Epicodus.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4" id="interests">My Interests</h1>
      <p>Like many of us, I spend far <strong>too much time</strong> staring at screens. Unfortunately, one of my favorite things to do is play <span class="highlightedText">video games</span>. Here are my favorite games:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Rocket League</li>
        <li>Fortnite</li>
        <li>Escape from Tarkov</li>
        <li>World of Warcraft</li>
        <li>Raft</li>
      </ol>
      <p>If I&rsquo;m not online I enjoy playing tennis, ping pong, racquetball or basketball. Being in northern Idaho I&rsquo;m also close to beautiful hiking and canoeing country, which I try to take advantage of every now and then.</p>
